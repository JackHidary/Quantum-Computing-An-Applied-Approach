##  About this book
This book integrates the foundations of quantum computing with a hands-on coding approach to this emerging field; it is the first work to bring these strands together in an updated manner. This work is suitable for both academic coursework and corporate technical training.

This volume comprises three books under one cover: Part I outlines the necessary foundations of quantum computing and quantum circuits. Part II walks through the canon of quantum computing algorithms and provides sample code for a range of quantum computing methods in current use. Part III provides the mathematical toolkit required for quantum computing. Additional resources include a table of operators and circuit elements. The companion GitHub site provides code examples and will be updated as the field progresses.

Jack D. Hidary is a researcher in quantum computing and in AI at Alphabet X, formerly Google X.
